Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

Example 1:
Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].

class Solution {
    public int distanceTraveled(int mainTank, int additionalTank) {
        return (mainTank + Math.min((mainTank - 1) / 4, additionalTank))* 10;
    }
}
